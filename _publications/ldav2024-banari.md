### Abstract
We propose and discuss a paradigm that allows for expressing data-parallel rendering with the classically non-parallel ANARI API. We propose this as a new standard for data-parallel rendering, describe two different implementations of this paradigm, and use multiple sample integrations into existing applications to show how easy it is to adopt, and what can be gained from doing so.
