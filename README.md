1. Run `bundle clean` to clean up the directory (no need to run `--force`)
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll liveserve` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Markdown Generator

There are python files in `scripts/` that convert a TSV containing structured data about talks (`talks.tsv`) or presentations (`presentations.tsv`) into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The notebooks contain a lot of documentation about the process. The .py files are pure python that do the same things if they are executed in a terminal, they just don't have pretty documentation.
