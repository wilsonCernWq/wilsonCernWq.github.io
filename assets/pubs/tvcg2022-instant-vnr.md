<figcaption align = "center">Figure 1: A) An overview of our work. The sampling step randomly and uniformly generates sample using the ground truth (GT) data. The ground truth data can be loaded via out-of-core streaming. The training step optimizes the neural network. The rendering step renders the neural network via in-shader or sample-streaming methods. Our approach accommodates both pre-training and online-training. Our novel contributions are highlighted in yellow. B) The architecture of our neural network with the multi-resolution hash grid encoding method.</figcaption>

### Note

This manuscript was originally titled "Instant Neural Representation for Interactive Volume Rendering", but in response to the valuable feedback received from reviewers, the title was subsequently revised.
